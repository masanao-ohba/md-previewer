 * - Preview panels are created with correct configuration
 * - Debouncing works to prevent excessive updates
 * - Resources are properly cleaned up on disposal
 *
 * Note: These are placeholder tests. Full testing of PreviewPanel requires
 * VSCode extension test environment which will be set up in Phase 4.
